# Contributing to desbot

Thank you for wanting to contribute to the project. The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to desbot, which is hosted on GitHub.

## Bugs
    
You can file a bug report on [GitHub][issues] and tag it as a bug, or on the official [Discord][discord] server, but please make sure to search for existing issues first.
    
## Suggestions

You can post a suggestion on [GitHub][issues] and tag it as an enhancement, or on the official [Discord][discord] server, but please make sure to search for existing suggestions first.

## Contributions

Right now the project is still coming together and will see a few more major changes, but it is built with extensibility in mind so in the future plugin development will be possible. 

If you want to contribute right now, the biggest need right now is frontend development as the editor is one massive class. Yeah, if you're a mildly masochistic programmer, get in touch on [Discord][discord]!
    
## Development

You don't need a special version of desbot to develop for it, the project is delivered as the source code, and can be modified at will. It is recommended to clone the project again though, so you have one bot to use when live, and one for development, unless you like to live dangerously.

To build the project with a JetBrains editor, add these file names patterns to `Settings > Editor > File Types > TypeScript config`: `tsconfig.server.json`, `tsconfig.client.json`.

## Roadmap

See `README.md` for the current roadmap.
