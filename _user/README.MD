# User Files

These files are all generated or added by the user or by using this solution. It is a good idea to back this up at some interval to prevent catastrophic data loss.

* assets - This is where all the user's assets are stored, this includes images, sounds, and other files.
* backups - This is where backup archives are stored, these are created when the user runs the backup scripts.
* data - This is where the dynamically updated data files are stored, these can change at runtime.
* db - This is where the user's database files are stored, these are created and managed automatically.
