# Source Folders
Short descriptions of what the different folders are supposed to contain.

## Classes
Things I couldn't put in any other bucket.
> ### Api
> Communicates with external APIs, local or remote.
> ### Data
> Helps crunch and presenting data.
> ### Web
> Components used for the web, should be moved.

## Constants
Will contain a collection of static values that are meant to be accessed and not changed. 

## Helpers
Static methods like Utils, but that make use of external data sources to give a result.

## Interfaces
General interfaces that are used all over the place.

## Runners
Extensions of prototypes of data objects so they contain code even if they can be exported for the browser.

## Singletons
Will provide a single static instance regardless of where it is called.

## Utils
Static methods that will perform the same action always, depending on input.
